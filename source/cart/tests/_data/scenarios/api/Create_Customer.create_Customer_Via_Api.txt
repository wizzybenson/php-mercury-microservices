I WANT TO CREATE CUSTOMER VIA API

I send post '/rest/customers/connect' 
I see response is json "" 
I grab data from response by json path 'access_token' 
I am bearer authenticated "$token" 
I am bearer authenticated 'b91121936ed8d2a2a26a' 
I have http header 'Content-Type'," 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' 
I see response code is "\Codeception\Util\HttpCode::OK" 
I see response is json "" 
I see response contains '{"result":"ok"}'
